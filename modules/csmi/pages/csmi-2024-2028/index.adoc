== Introduction 


We discuss here the evolution of the Master Track.  It's important to ensure that the program is meeting the needs of students and providing them with the skills and knowledge necessary for success in their chosen careers.

The main purpose of the CSMI Master's program is to provide students with advanced skills in both mathematics and computer science, with a focus on modeling, simulation, optimization, signal and image processing, data mining, and high-performance computing. 
The program aims to equip students with the theoretical and practical knowledge necessary to tackle complex problems in the socio-economic world, and to prepare them for careers in research and development departments of companies, service companies, specialized consulting firms, or engineering positions in universities and public or private research organizations.

In real life work, the skills developed in the CSMI program are highly valued by employers in a wide range of fields. For example:

- Modeling, simulation, and optimization skills are highly relevant in industries such as finance, energy, transportation, and healthcare, where companies must optimize complex systems to improve efficiency and reduce costs.
- Signal and image processing skills are valuable in fields such as telecommunications, defense, and medical imaging, where companies must analyze and interpret large volumes of data.
- Data mining skills are highly sought after in industries such as marketing, e-commerce, and finance, where companies must analyze large datasets to identify trends and patterns.
- High-performance computing skills are valuable in many scientific and engineering fields, where companies must simulate complex systems or process large amounts of data in a timely manner.

Overall, the CSMI Master's program is designed to prepare students for highly rewarding careers in a wide range of fields, where they can apply their skills to tackle complex real-world problems and make a positive impact on society.

We start by recalling the socio-economical impact study of mathemacs (EISEM in french) then a short presentation of the current Master track, then we discuss the evolution of the program, and finally we propose a new maquette for the program.

== Socio-Economical and Research Context 

=== National Context : EISEM report

The EISEM report was commissioned by the Agency for mathematics in interaction with entreprises and mathematical societies(AMIES) in 2015 and updated in 2022 by CNRS INSMI to evaluate the socio-economic impact of mathematics in France. The report highlights the crucial role that mathematics plays in driving innovation and competitiveness in a wide range of industries, and identified key technologies that are central to the needs of the socio-economic world.

The CSMI Master's program at the University of Strasbourg is specifically designed to address these needs, by providing students with advanced skills in the key technologies identified by the EISEM report. For example, the program includes courses in modeling, simulation, optimization, signal and image processing, data mining, and high-performance computing, which are all key areas highlighted in the EISEM report.

By equipping students with these advanced skills, the CSMI program aims to prepare them for careers in research and development departments of companies, service companies, specialized consulting firms, or engineering positions in universities and public or private research organizations. These are all areas where mathematics plays a crucial role in driving innovation and competitiveness, and where the skills developed in the CSMI program can make a significant contribution.

The november 2022 version is available link:https://www.insmi.cnrs.fr/fr/cnrsinfo/les-mathematiques-un-impact-majeur#:~:text=Math%C3%A9matiques%20%3A%20un%20atout%20pour%20l,de%20valeur%20ajout%C3%A9e%20en%202019[here].

Here are some key points of the latest report:

* In 2019, 3.3 million salaried jobs, or 13% of all salaried jobs, were impacted by mathematics, contributing 381 billion euros in added value​​.
* From 2012 to 2019, the share of salaried jobs impacted by mathematics in total salaried employment in France increased by almost 14%. Moreover, the contribution of mathematics to the country's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by two percentage points, from 16% to 18%​​.
*Almost half of the salaried jobs impacted by mathematics are concentrated in Ile-de-France (35%) and Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes (12%)​​.
* Sectors that heavily demand mathematics include: computer services (78% of jobs impacted by mathematics), scientific research and development (72%), production and distribution of electricity and gas (59%), telecommunications (59%), and manufacturing of computer, electronic, and optical products (57%). From 2016 to 2019, the share of jobs impacted by mathematics significantly increased in telecommunications (47% in 2016 vs. 59% in 2019), the pharmaceutical industry (41% to 44%), and financial and insurance activities (29% to 32%)​​.
* Five sectors account for half of the jobs impacted by mathematics: legal, accounting, management, architecture, engineering, control, and technical analysis services (15%); computer services (11%); financial and insurance activities (8%); commerce (8%); construction (6%)​​.
* There is a risk of a shortage of people with mathematical training, which companies fear could impact the country's sovereignty. Economic actors are actively seeking three types of intermediate and advanced skills that are in short supply: advanced skills in mathematics development (often destined for R&D positions) and advanced skills in multidisciplinary use of mathematics (usually destined for R&D positions or data scientist roles).

The text highlights several areas where collaborations between the academic world of mathematics and businesses should be encouraged:

Identification of Mathematical Skills:: Businesses often don't identify the mathematical skills that can be mobilized in the economic world. Therefore, efforts should be made to improve the understanding of the skills of PhDs in mathematics and how these can be applied in a business context.

Increasing Visibility and Access:: The visibility of and access to the scientific mathematical community are crucial factors for collaboration. Actions by the Agency for Mathematics in Interaction with Enterprises and Society (AMIES) that provide an interface between businesses and research laboratories, such as funding for exploratory first support (PEPS) projects and weeks of mathematical business studies (SEME), should be amplified and made known to all businesses.

Enhancing Innovation:: France is a nation of mathematics whose quality of training and research is regularly acclaimed, notably by the highest international awards (for example, the Fields Medal awarded to Hugo Duminil-Copin). About 33% of mathematics PhD graduates in 2017 specialized in fields immediately useful to businesses (numerical analysis and scientific computing, statistics, probabilities, and stochastic models). All mathematics PhD students acquire skills necessary for businesses, such as the ability to work on a complex, time-limited project by dividing it into projects with intermediate objectives, and the ability to communicate results.

=== Local and Regional Context: Cemosis 

CSMI benefits greatly from its association with the local platform Cemosis at the University of Strasbourg. Cemosis plays a crucial role in fostering collaborations between mathematics, businesses, and other disciplines, creating a dynamic environment for innovation and knowledge exchange.

As a part of the regional European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIH) network starting in Fall 2023, Cemosis will be at the forefront of accelerating the digital transformation in the Grand Est region. This network, led by Grand-Enov, aims to promote and support digital innovation across various sectors and industries. By being connected to this network, CSMI gains access to a wider ecosystem of expertise, resources, and opportunities.

The inclusion of Cemosis in the EDIH network reflects the recognition of its significant contribution to the digital landscape and its potential to drive innovation in the region. CSMI students can leverage this ecosystem to collaborate with businesses, engage in cutting-edge projects, and stay up-to-date with the latest technological advancements.

Overall, Cemosis and its involvement in the EDIH network further enhance the local and regional context of CSMI, positioning it as a program that not only prepares students with advanced mathematical and computational skills but also connects them with real-world opportunities and collaborations in the digital domain.

=== A Strong Local Research Ecosystem

Starting Fall 2023, the applied mathematics team and Cemosis at UNISTRA will actively participate in two significant initiatives: PEPR Numpex and PEPR AI. These collaborations bring several benefits to CSMI students, enhancing their learning experience and future prospects.

[[pepr-numpex]]
1. PEPR Numpex: As part of the PEPR Numpex initiative, the applied mathematics team and Cemosis will contribute to the methods, algorithms and the development of the software stack for exascale computing.

== Evolution of the Master CSMI

There are several reasons why updating the Master track CSMI is beneficial. Here are a few  reasons:

Keeping up with changing industry demands:: The world of mathematics and computer science is constantly evolving, and so are the needs of employers. By updating the Master track CSMI, we can ensure that our graduates have the skills and knowledge that are most in demand in the current job market.

Attracting more students:: Students are often drawn to Master's programs that offer cutting-edge courses and relevant, practical training. By updating the CSMI program with new courses on high-performance computing, machine learning, and data assimilation, we may be able to attract more students who are interested in these fields.

Strengthening industry partnerships:: By incorporating projects with companies and internships throughout the program, as well as courses that are directly relevant to industry needs, we can build stronger partnerships with companies and potentially create more job opportunities for our graduates.

Enhancing the reputation of the program:: By offering a program that is up-to-date and relevant, we can enhance the reputation of the CSMI program and increase its visibility both nationally and internationally. This can help attract the best students and faculty to the program, and create more opportunities for collaboration and funding.

We aim at updating the Master track CSMI in several ways:

- Updating the course offerings to reflect new developments in mathematics and computer science
- Introducing new courses or modifying existing courses to better meet the needs of students
- Increasing the number of courses taught in English to better prepare students for international settings
- Providing more opportunities for practical experience, such as internships or industry partnerships
- Incorporating more interdisciplinary coursework to help students understand the connections between mathematics and computer science and other fields

In particular, we propose to add courses on high-performance computing, machine learning, as these are all areas where there is high demand for skilled professionals. We also propose to introduce more interdisciplinary coursework, such as courses on scientific machine learning and data assimilation, to help students understand the connections between mathematics and computer science and other fields.


=== A change of name

The name of the Master track CSMI has been used for a few years now. Changing name is not a trivial matter. We can keep the name but change its meaning.
It currently means : "Calcul Scientifique et Mathématiques de l'Information".

The term "Mathematics of Information" refers to a field of study that focuses on the mathematical principles, theories, and methods used in the analysis, processing, and communication of information. It involves the application of mathematical concepts and techniques to various aspects of information processing, including data compression, coding theory, information theory, cryptography, error correction, signal processing, and more. The master track CSMI is not focused on these topics anymore and we should be careful that the name does not mislead students.

We can make the following changes:

Calcul Scientifique et Mathématiques de l'Innovation:: This translates to "Scientific Computing and Mathematics of Innovation" in English. It emphasizes the focus on leveraging mathematical and computational techniques to drive innovation in various fields.
Calcul Scientifique et Mathématiques de l'Industrie:: This translates to "Scientific Computing and Mathematics of Industry" in English. It highlights the application of mathematical and computational methods in industrial settings, addressing challenges and optimizing processes in various industrial sectors.
Calcul Scientifique et Mathématiques de l'Ingénieur:: This translates to "Scientific Computing and Mathematics of Engineering" in English. It emphasizes the application of mathematical and computational techniques in engineering disciplines, supporting the development of innovative solutions and technologies.

NOTE: As the person responsible for the Master CSMI my preference goes to the first proposition.

=== English courses versus Courses in English

In response to student feedback, the Master CSMI program has implemented changes to the curriculum regarding English language courses. The previous offering of two 3 ECTS English courses in Semester 1 and Semester 3, aimed at enhancing English skills, has been eliminated due to poor reception among students.

Instead, the program now includes at least 2 or 3 standard courses per semester taught in English, along with projects that require students to write reports and deliver presentations in English. This modification aims to provide students with more flexibility in their course selection while still incorporating English language instruction. By integrating English language learning within regular courses, students can develop their English skills in a more practical and contextual manner in applied mathematics and applications.

Mixing languages in a master track can offer several benefits:

Language Proficiency:: Students have the opportunity to improve their proficiency in both French and English, which are valuable skills in today's globalized world. Developing competency in multiple languages can enhance students' communication abilities and open up international career prospects.

Cultural Competence:: Exposure to different languages and cultures enriches students' understanding and appreciation of diverse perspectives. It fosters a multicultural learning environment, promoting intercultural competence and broadening students' horizons.

Career Opportunities:: Proficiency in both French and English is often sought after by employers, particularly in international or multinational organizations. Having a mastery of both languages can provide graduates with a competitive edge in the job market.

Multilingual Communication Skills:: By requiring reports and oral presentations in English, students develop the ability to effectively communicate complex concepts in a second language. This skillset is highly valuable in professional settings where multilingual communication is required.

However, it's important to ensure that 

1. the language requirements and expectations are clearly communicated to students beforehand, so they can adequately prepare and manage their language learning. 
2. we provide some support, such as language resources or language assistance programs, can also be beneficial to help students succeed in a multilingual environment.

Overall, a master track that combines French and English courses, along with opportunities for report writing and oral presentations in English, can offer a unique and attractive learning experience, preparing students for international collaboration and global career opportunities.

Furthermore, the Master CSMI program recognizes the potential to attract students from various European countries and beyond, taking advantage of its geographical proximity to Germany and Luxembourg. While the program previously had limited exposure to English-language courses, the curriculum changes in this document present an opportunity to appeal to a broader international student base.

By offering a combination of French and English courses, along with opportunities for report writing and oral presentations in English, the program can now cater to the needs of students from different linguistic backgrounds. 

To ensure clear communication of language requirements and expectations to students:

* Clearly outline language requirements in program documentation.
* Include language-related information in course descriptions.
* Organize orientation sessions to provide detailed information on language expectations.
* Maintain ongoing communication with students about language requirements and updates.
* Include explicit language expectations in course syllabi.
* Ensure faculty are aware of language requirements and provide guidance.
* Establish student support services for language assistance and practice through the use of modern technologies (not yet clear for example if we can use the language center of the university even though we don't use the course facilities).

These measures help students prepare and manage their language learning effectively.

A short survey of the current Master track CSMI teachers (13 answers) shows that 46% are willing to teach in English, 38% may be willing to do it and only 10% are not willing to teach in English. This is a good sign for the future of the program since we would like to have both courses in french and english.

.Inquiry: Would you be willing to teach in English in the future?
image::inquiry-english-courses.png[width=600px]

The next figure show that courses may be taught in English in various ways in about the same proportion: courses taught in english completely, course taught in french but the course notes are in english, exercices in english, oral presentations and written reports can be in english. We can leverage this to implement the plan above.

.Inquiry: How would you teach in english?
image::inquiry-english-how.png[width=600px]

In the <<_courses,courses section>> we propose a list of courses that can be taught in english. We can see that the list is quite long and that we can easily have half of the courses per semester taught in english.

=== Introduction to Scientific Maching Learning

The SciML courses would ideally complement and bridge the knowledge provided by the standalone Machine Learning (ML) and Scientific Computing courses in a master's track. Here's a brief overview of how they might fit:

ML Courses:: These provide the fundamental concepts and techniques of machine learning. They would cover topics like linear regression, logistic regression, SVMs, neural networks, and more advanced topics like deep learning, reinforcement learning, and unsupervised learning methods. They would also discuss evaluation metrics, overfitting, underfitting, and other concepts relevant to ML model training and validation.

Scientific Computing Courses:: These would delve into the mathematical and computational methods used to model and solve scientific and engineering problems. Topics would include numerical methods, linear algebra, differential equations, optimization, and potentially high-performance computing.

SciML Courses:: These courses would serve as the bridge between the ML and Scientific Computing courses. They would take the machine learning techniques learned in the ML courses and apply them to the problems discussed in the Scientific Computing courses, and vice versa.

In terms of the order, it would be ideal for students to first complete the ML and Scientific Computing courses, as these will provide the foundational knowledge necessary for understanding and applying SciML. The SciML courses could then be taken towards the end of the master's track, allowing students to apply all the knowledge they've gained in a novel and interdisciplinary way. The final projects in the SciML courses could potentially even serve as the basis for a master's thesis or capstone project.


Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) courses can be highly beneficial for applied mathematicians in a master's track for several reasons:

Interdisciplinary Knowledge:: SciML is inherently interdisciplinary, combining elements of computer science, applied mathematics, and domain-specific knowledge (e.g., physics, biology, etc.). This wide range of knowledge can be beneficial for applied mathematicians who want to apply their skills in various fields.

Real-World Applications:: SciML has a host of real-world applications. These range from climate modeling to drug discovery to predictive maintenance and more. This can provide applied mathematicians with a practical outlet for their skills.

Cutting Edge:: SciML is a relatively new and rapidly developing field. Being trained in this area can provide applied mathematicians with skills that are in high demand in both academia and industry.

Data-Driven Modeling:: Traditionally, applied mathematics has focused on model-driven approaches where mathematical models are derived based on understanding of the underlying phenomena. However, in many real-world problems, the phenomena are too complex to be fully captured by such models. In such cases, data-driven modeling, as used in SciML, can be a powerful tool.

Improved Prediction and Generalization:: Incorporating physical laws and principles into ML models, as is done in SciML, can lead to better generalization and predictive performance, particularly when data is scarce. This can be a valuable skill for applied mathematicians working on data-limited problems.

Here is an example as of May 2023 of a SciML course:

* The https://engineering.purdue.edu/online/courses/introduction-scientific-machine-learning[course "Introduction to Scientific Machine Learning" at Purdue University] provides an excellent framework for an introductory course in SciML. The course introduces data science to engineers with no prior knowledge and follows a probabilistic perspective that highlights the first principles behind the presented methods. It covers a variety of topics, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, state space models, and physics-informed deep learning. It also offers training in various Python coding skills and commonly used data analytics software​​.

and here is an example of introductory course for ML:

* https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-machine-learning-2[Another comprehensive course that could serve as a reference is the edX course also from Purdue University], which provides an extensive review of probability theory, uncertainty propagation, supervised and unsupervised learning, state-space models, and automated Bayesian inference. It also covers advanced topics such as Gaussian process regression, neural networks, and advanced methods for characterizing posteriors. The prerequisites for this course include a working knowledge of multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra, basic Python knowledge, and familiarity with probability and numerical methods for engineering​​.

=== Blurring the line between Model driven versus data driven modeling and data assimilation

Model-driven modeling and data-driven modeling represent two different approaches to understanding and predicting system behavior. 
We plan on showing CSMI students how to use both approaches in their work, and how to combine them in a principled and practical way.

Model-driven Modeling:: This approach is based on the use of first principles, often derived from the physical sciences, to create a mathematical model of a system. The model incorporates known laws of physics, chemistry, or other relevant fields to predict system behavior. This method is powerful for situations where the underlying physical processes are well-understood and can be accurately represented mathematically. However, it can struggle in situations where the system is too complex or poorly understood to be accurately represented by a simplified mathematical model.

Data-driven Modeling:: This approach is based on the use of data and statistical methods to understand system behavior. In this case, a model is created based on observed data rather than on first principles. Machine learning techniques are often used to "learn" the model from the data. Data-driven modeling can be very effective in situations where there is a lot of high-quality data available, and it can capture complex, non-linear relationships that might be missed by a simpler model-driven approach. However, it can struggle in situations where data is scarce or noisy, and it can sometimes result in models that are difficult to interpret or that do not generalize well to new situations.

In the context of advanced courses at a master's level, it can be beneficial to teach both model-driven and data-driven modeling techniques, as well as ways to combine the two approaches. This can be done in several ways:

Model-informed Machine Learning:: In this approach, physical models are used to inform the structure or training of machine learning models. For example, conservation laws or other physical principles can be used as constraints in the learning process. This can help to improve the accuracy and generalizability of machine learning models, particularly in situations where data is scarce or noisy.

Machine Learning-enhanced Modeling:: In this approach, machine learning models are used to enhance traditional model-driven modeling techniques. For example, machine learning models can be used to learn error terms or corrections to a physics-based model, or to model complex phenomena that are not well-captured by a simple physics-based model.

In these advanced courses, students can be exposed to the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, and learn how to choose and apply the most appropriate modeling techniques for a given problem. They can also learn how to integrate physical knowledge with machine learning in a principled way, which is a key aspect of Scientific Machine Learning. Practical exercises and projects that involve both model-driven and data-driven modeling can be a valuable part of these courses, providing students with hands-on experience of the techniques they are learning.

Data assimilation is another powerful method that blends model-driven and data-driven modeling, and it's often used in fields such as meteorology, oceanography, and geophysics where both model predictions and observational data are available.

Data Assimilation:: This process involves combining observational data with the output of a predictive model to improve the model's estimates of the state of a system. This is often done in a sequential manner, where the model's state estimate is updated each time new data becomes available. The goal is to minimize the discrepancy between the model's predictions and the actual observations, and to account for uncertainties in both the model and the data.

There are several methods of data assimilation, including:

Kalman Filter:: This is a recursive method used for estimating the state of a linear dynamic system from a series of measurements. It takes into account the uncertainties in the model and the measurements.

Ensemble Kalman Filter:: This is an extension of the Kalman filter which is used for non-linear systems. It uses a Monte Carlo approach to represent the probability distribution of the state estimate.

4D-Var (Four-Dimensional Variational data assimilation):: This method involves adjusting the model's state at the start of a time window to minimize the discrepancy between the model's predictions and the observations over the entire time window. This methodology stems for Control Theory.

In the context of master-level courses, data assimilation can be a valuable topic to cover, as it provides students with practical techniques for integrating model-driven and data-driven approaches. It also provides exposure to important concepts such as uncertainty quantification and state estimation. Coursework could include practical exercises involving the implementation and application of data assimilation methods, and could cover advanced topics such as the design of optimal observation systems.

=== High Performance Computing

High-Performance Computing (HPC) has been an essential tool for scientific research, industry, and technology development for several decades. 
The scale of computational power we can harness has grown rapidly, from gigaflops in the 1990s to petaflops in the 2010s, and we are now on the brink of the exascale era.

Programs like <<pepr-numpex,NumPEx>>, the French initiative for  Exascale computing, reflect this trend and underscore the importance of preparing for the next wave of computational capabilities footnote:[https://numpex.fr/]. NumPEx aims to design and develop the methods, algorithms and software components for future exascale machines and prepare major scientific and industrial application domains to fully exploit the capabilities of these machines.

This evolution in computing power necessitates an evolution in the skills and tools we use to harness it. The architectures of modern supercomputers are becoming more complex, with an increasing variety of hardware components that need to be programmed and optimized. The programming models we use to write parallel and distributed applications are also evolving, requiring programmers to understand and mix different programming paradigms, such as MPI, multi-threading, and GPU programming. Runtime execution systems are becoming crucial for managing the execution of programs on complex hardware.

To prepare for this future, we offer a sequence of three courses on High-Performance Computing as part of the CSMI Master's program. These courses will give students a deep understanding of modern HPC, from the basics of parallel programming and numerical methods to the advanced techniques of hybrid computing and runtime systems. The courses will also introduce students to state-of-the-art HPC tools and frameworks, such as PETSc, that will be essential for tackling the computational challenges of the future.

These courses are not just about learning the theory of HPC; they're about gaining practical skills that will equip students to contribute to the next wave of breakthroughs in scientific research, technology development, and industry, powered by exascale computing.

|===
|Course |Description

|HPC 1: Foundations of High-Performance Computing
|This foundational course introduces students to the architectures of modern supercomputers, focusing on CPUs and the interconnect, and the basics of parallel programming with the Message Passing Interface (MPI). We will also introduce numerical methods for scientific computation and the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation (PETSc footnote:[https://petsc.org/release/]) as a general framework for implementing these methods in an HPC context.

|HPC 2: Advanced Techniques in High-Performance Computing
|Building on HPC 1, this course delves deeper into parallel computing, focusing on multi-threading techniques using OpenMP and GPU programming with CUDA or OpenCL. Students will learn how to leverage the power of multi-core processors and GPUs to accelerate their computations. We will continue our exploration of PETSc on top of Nvidia Cuda and AMD Hip, showing how it can be used to manage complex multi-threaded and GPU-accelerated computations.

|HPC 3: High-Performance Computing for the Future
|The final course will cover the concept of hybrid computing, which involves mixing different programming models and hardware in a single program, and runtime execution systems that manage the execution of programs on complex, heterogeneous hardware. Performance analysis, optimization, parallel I/O and data management will also be covered. We will discuss how frameworks like PETSc  can be used in this context to help manage the complexity of hybrid computing and runtime systems.
