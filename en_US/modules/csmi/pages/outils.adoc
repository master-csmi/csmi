CSMI uses link:https://slack.com/intl/fr-fr/[Slack] to communicate with promotions and on projects.

You can install slack and create your account with your email `@etu.unistra.fr` once you have it.
You'll receive an invitation at the start of the school year.

The Slack workspace used is that of {feelpp}, the numerical simulation software developed by Cemosis. The channels used are

`#csmi-202x`:: for 202x promotions
`#csmi`:: for questions about the CSMI Master's program

The number one platform for open-source projects using git as a version control system, the platform also offers a lot of tools for project management. +
We'll be using https://github.com/features/issues[Github management tools] to keep track of projects and assignments. +
You need to create an account on Github, a form will be sent at the beginning of the M1 year and your account will follow you during the 2 years. It will be used
+
* - for projects in S2 and S3
* - during internships, to submit your reports and presentations
* - during internships for some of you, for follow-up purposes
* - during EDP (S2) and CS3 courses, via the https://classroom.github.com[github classroom] platform, to hand in your assignments.

.Academic integrity & privacy (please read)
[.def#academic-integrity]
****
* - **Cite AI assistance** when it meaningfully contributes to your work (e.g., “Assisted by AI: prompt + tool name/version/date”).
* - **Do not paste** confidential material (exam statements, private repos, API keys, personal data) into online tools.
* - **Verify outputs** (numerics, code, references). You are responsible for correctness and reproducibility.
* - Keep a **reproducible workflow**: keep prompts, versions, and generated code in your repo (e.g., `ai-notes/`).
