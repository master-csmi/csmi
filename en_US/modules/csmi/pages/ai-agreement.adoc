* [ ] **Acknowledge** possible institutional / legal consequences of data misuse  
* [ ] **Use** only tools whose data handling I understand (retention, training use)

=== 4. Academic Integrity
* [ ] **Acknowledge** that undisclosed or deceptive AI use = academic integrity violation

* [ ] **Retain** log until final grading / defense is complete
