= Master CSMI: Current Track 2016-2023

== Description

The CSMI Master's program is at the heart of the digital revolution, focusing on models, data, and algorithms. It aims to train students to be key players in the digital revolution, equipping them with cross-disciplinary skills in mathematics and computer science and a strong grasp of various application domains such as health, environment, economy, and micro-technology.

The program is designed to prepare students for the rapid technological changes and challenges in the digital world by providing them with the knowledge and skills needed in the areas of image processing, modeling, simulation, optimization, and high performance computing.

== Main Components

=== Data and Machine Learning

This component covers the fundamentals of data analysis and machine learning. Students will learn about statistical methods, data analysis techniques, and machine learning algorithms. They will gain the ability to analyze and interpret complex datasets, and develop algorithms to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data.

=== Modeling Simulation Optimisation

Modeling, Simulation, and Optimisation (MSO) is considered the third pillar of scientific progress and innovation, alongside experimentation and theory. In this component, students will learn about mathematical modeling, simulation techniques, and optimization methods. They will gain the ability to develop precise methods for MSO, which is increasingly important in the context of the growing importance of high-performance computing and Big Data technologies.

=== High Performance Computing

High Performance Computing (HPC) involves the use of supercomputers and parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. In this component, students will learn about the architecture of high-performance computers, parallel programming techniques, and the design and optimization of high-performance algorithms.

=== Signal and Image Processing

Signal and image processing involves the analysis, interpretation, and manipulation of signals and images. In this component, students will learn about various methods and techniques for signal and image processing, including filtering, pattern recognition, and image enhancement. They will gain the ability to develop algorithms for processing and analyzing signals and images.
